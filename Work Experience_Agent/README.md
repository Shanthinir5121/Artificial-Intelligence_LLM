This project is a command-line based Work Experience Builder. It helps users convert raw work experience into professional, ATS-optimized resume entries with minimal effort.

The system collects job details interactively from the user, processes them through an LLM, and generates:

-> Polished role descriptions

-> 4 high-impact bullet points for each role

-> A dedicated “Improvement Section” for skills & achievements

-> Fully formatted resume-ready output

-> It allows adding multiple experiences in a loop, providing a seamless and natural workflow for building a complete resume experience section.
