This project is a simple command-line application that helps users collect and store project details using a Large Language Model (LLM). The script allows users to enter short project inputs, processes them through an LLM to generate a clean title and well-written description, and finally stores each project entry in a list. After the user finishes adding projects, all saved project details are displayed in a neatly formatted output.

Features

-> Interactive CLI that repeatedly asks for project inputs

-> Uses an LLM to generate:
    Professional project title
    Clear and structured project description
    
-> Supports adding multiple projects

-> Clean formatting for easy copying into resumes, LinkedIn, or portfolio
